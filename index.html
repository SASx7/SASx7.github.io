	Hello! I am an engineering graduate interested in computer science. Other than learning to code, I like to write and draw in my free time. Physically, I like to play squash and fashion myself as a semi-professional, though I haven't entered in any tournaments, given the rarity of said tournaments in Chennai.

				My Experience: <br> 

				I have been working in a service based IT company for the last 3 years. During my time here, I have worked on C# projects, a brief stint supporting a product coded in Delphi (a predecessor to C#). The most important thing that I would say that I learned during my time here is my people skills and how to convey your idea in such a way that it does not confuse your client. This saves a lot of time, especially if an error in communication causes reworks in the product escpecially during the later stages of a project. AGILE does help here but then again proper communication still helps a lot.
